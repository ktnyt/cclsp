- Implemented CI workarounds for environment-specific test issues

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to @secondcircle for the major enhancement that transforms cclsp from a read-only query tool into a functional refactoring tool with actual file editing capabilities (#13). This change significantly improves the user experience from preview-only to actually applying changes.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-08-16
