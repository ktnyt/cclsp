### Testing

- Added comprehensive test suite for file editing functionality (100+ test cases)
- Implemented CI workarounds for environment-specific test issues

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to @secondcircle for the major enhancement that transforms cclsp from a read-only query tool into a functional refactoring tool with actual file editing capabilities (#13). This change significantly improves the user experience from preview-only to actually applying changes.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-08-16

  - Now properly handles both WorkspaceEdit and DocumentChanges response formats
  - Improved compatibility with language servers using the newer LSP specification

### Documentation

- Updated MCP tools documentation to match current implementation
- Added MseeP.ai badge to README (PR #4 by @lwsinclair)

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the contributors of recent enhancements and fixes.

- @secondcircle for fixing the critical rename operation issue with modern LSP servers (#11)
- @lwsinclair for adding the MseeP.ai badge to improve project visibility (#4)
